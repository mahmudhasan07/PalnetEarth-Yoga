In 1986 they traveled together to India and took the Sivananda teacher training program and met Swami Nirmalananda. Upon their return, they opened the first Jivamukti Yoga Society in the East Village of New York City.[5] In 1990 they began to practice Ashtanga Yoga with Pattabhi Jois in Mysore, India. In 1993, in upstate New York, they met yoga scholar and ashram founder Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati (Yogi Mishra). In 1998, having become 'wildly successful', the yoga center moved to a 9,000 square feet (840 m2) studio on Lafayette Street; some 400 people subscribed, annual membership at that time costing $1200, rather more than a typical gym.[6] The journalist and author Stefanie Syman ascribes"

        "short_note": "As the name suggests, power yoga is focused on building strength and endurance. It is also an excellent form of yoga for burning calories. Although power yoga isn’t an official type of yoga, the term is sometimes used interchangeably with Vinyasa yoga. It’s probably more accurate to say that power yoga is a form of Vinyasa, which has its roots in Ashtanga yoga, an established practice that began in the early 20th century. With power yoga, the emphasis is on the flow from one pose to the next, rather than approaching each pose separately. The poses aren’t disconnected from each other, unlike some other forms of yoga. No matter what you call it, power yoga is a fast-paced and intense activity. You move from one posture to another rapidly, linking your breathing to the different motions of your body."

The base – this is the person who is closest to the ground. Often times in acroyoga it is the person who is lying with on her/his back on the ground and the legs and arms extended into the air. The base can also be standing (standing acro) or lying on the belly (belly basing). The main goal of the base is to carry and balance the flyer on top of her/him. An experienced base is strong, stable, and flexible so they can remain a solid foundation for the flyer to stay on."
